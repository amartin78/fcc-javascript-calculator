-- if number is zero and = is entererd no operation is done
    e.g. = => 0

--  if negative sign pressed followed by decimal point it should display point preceded by zero
    e.g. - .   => -0.
         - . 6 => -0.6

-- if a number is entered and inmediatly equals is pressed, it returns that number
    e.g.  6  = =>  6
         -8  = => -8

-- if a number followed by % operation and equals is entered it should return the result
    e.g. 8% = => 0.08

-- if square root operand is entered followed by a number and equals operator it should return the result
    e.g.  √9   = =>  3
         -√81  = => -9
          √-36 = => Error

-- if square root operation is followed by another operation it should return the result
    e.g. √36 + 2 = 8

-- if no number is entered then it must return the first value intruduced
   (no empty values should be introduced)
    e.g. 8 + =  => 8 + 8 = 16
         7 * =  => 7 * 7 = 49
         -6 / = => -6 / -6 = 1

-- Pressing an operator inmediatly following equals should start a new calculation based on the previous 
   evaluation
   e.g. 3 + 6 = 9 + 2 => 12
        3 + 6 = 9 - 2 =>  7

-- Pressing equals after an operation should repeat the last calculation
    e.g. 3 (+ 6) = 9 = => 15 = => 21 = => 27
         7 (* -3) = -21 = => 63 = => -189

-- If an operand (+ - * / % =) is pressed with no number entered, it should return 0
